üé≤ Overview

Nips Roll (NRG) is a lightweight WoW 3.3.5a addon for Project Epoch (and other Wrath private servers) that makes hosting fun roll-based betting games easy. Inspired by Cross Gambling, it adds Hi/Lo roll games and 1v1 Death Rolls, with automatic announcements, player joins, and result tracking.
