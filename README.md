Quick usage (host)

Open with /nrg.

Pick Channel (SAY, PARTY, RAID, BATTLEGROUND).

Choose Mode:

Hi/Lo (default): Everyone will /roll 1–100 (configurable). Highest number (i.e., closest to 100) wins; lowest pays highest the bet.

Death Roll (1v1): Set P1 and P2, choose a Start Max (default 1000). Players alternate /roll 1-X; whoever hits 1 loses and pays.

Set Bet (gold).

Click New Game → it announces “NIPS ROLL GAME STARTED, PRESS 1 TO JOIN”.

People type 1 in the chosen channel to join; they appear in the list.

Click Last Call if you want.

Click Start Rolling!

Hi/Lo: The addon listens for /roll <min>-<max> results and auto-announces settlement: “<low> pays <high> <bet>g.”

Death Roll: It enforces turn order, updates the current max each roll, and announces the loser/winner and settlement.

Cancel/Reset ends the current session and clears the roster.
